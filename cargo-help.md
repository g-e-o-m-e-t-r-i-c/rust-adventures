# look! a cargo project

- `cargo new <project_name>` to initiate a project
- `cargo build` to build the `src/main.rs` file (and also update dependencies)
- run the executable binary at `./target/debug/<project_name>` to see the result!

- `cargo check` to check for errors without producing binary
- `cargo run` to compile and run

this is compiled on linux (debian/ubuntu) x86_64, so other OSes and architectures don't work.
