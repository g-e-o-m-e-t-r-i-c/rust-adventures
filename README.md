# rust-adventures

Follow me on my journey in learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)!

## What does it have?

This repository consists of:

- Tutorials I follow from the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book)
- My attempts at the [exercises](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example) (Rust By Example)

There is also a short [`cargo` cheatsheet](https://github.com/g-e-o-m-e-t-r-i-c/rust-adventures/blob/master/cargo-help.md) to help myself (and you guys, maybe) out with the package manager!
