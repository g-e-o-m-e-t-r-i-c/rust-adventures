# look! a cargo project

- `cargo new <project_name>` to initiate a project
- `cargo build` to build the `src/main.rs` file
- run the executable binary at `./target/debug/<project_name>` to see the result!

- `cargo check` to check for errors without producing binary


this is compiled on linux (debian/ubuntu) x86\_64, so other OSes and architectures don't work.
